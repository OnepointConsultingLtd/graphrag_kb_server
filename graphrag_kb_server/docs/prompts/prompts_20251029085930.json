It is a set of techniques and models for building computer software without programming, using data sets to automatically build models. This learning process involves the continuous renewal of knowledge and algorithmic models based on interactions with digital data. It is a sub-symbolic AI approach that filters meaning from data and excels at pattern recognition and generalization. Machine Learning is a broad category of AI systems that use data to create algorithms without explicit programming. It is often confused with AI itself. It has been disjointed from symbolic AI but is now being combined in neuro-symbolic AI to leverage data and improve explainability. It is used to gather intelligence, make predictions, and provide insights into data. It is utilized in various applications, including transcribing audio into text, predicting energy consumption in buildings, improving chatbot performance and accuracy, optimizing business value, allowing engineers to build AI models and generate dashboards, and analyzing sales behaviors to predict outcomes in revenue intelligence. Organizations are increasingly building out the use of Machine Learning, integrating it with causal AI in Neuro-Symbolic systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs).

AlphaGo also uses Machine Learning. Stephane Cheikh uses Machine Learning to improve various processes. Machine Learning is used for deeper analysis of aggregated data in the cloud. However, Machine Learning is subject to data challenges and bias, and its performance can be negatively affected by poor quality data. While it learns from data, it may not always provide logical proof for its decisions, lacks explainability and transparency, and cannot replace human judgment in critical decisions. Regulators have restricted its use in important decisions like credit decisions, but it is acceptable for less critical applications like movie recommendations. Machine Learning is contrasted with knowledge graphs for clinical decision-making, as it predicts rather than provides judgment. The field of Machine Learning, like AI, experienced a period of decline before the rise of GPT models. Rain Bird does not use Machine Learning, instead relying on symbolic AI and knowledge graphs. Machine Learning is not suitable for augmenting decision making in the R&D domain. Machine Learning is a technology posing challenges for personal data privacy.

The license potential for the European public sector market is calculated using our standard price mechanism.\\n\\n- \uf0b7 In tier 1: We see an average of 12 to 15 relevant central agencies for our business solution  per European country. 2 Applying our standard price mechanism would yield a market of \u20ac 2,2 billion\\n- \uf0b7 In tier 2: Total market size is similar as tier 1, but divided over more, but smaller agencies.\\n- \uf0b7 In tier 3: Based on individual business cases and in close cooperation with local partners. We foresee an equal market size as tier 1.\\n\\nThis calculation leads up to an annual market size of circa \u20ac 6,5 billion for public sector in Europe. The financial services market is of similar size. Europe represents roughly 1/3 of the IT spent in the world. This would lead to a market estimate of \u20ac 39 billion.\\n\\nCompare: Analyst firm Forrester estimates the market for smart process apps at $34 Billion by 2015.

This service was supplied to a large number of government departments (Education, Culture and Science (OCW), Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM), Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK), The Tax Administration, Customs and a number of e-government programs.\\n\\nIn 2007, another breakthrough came with the award of a contract for a nationwide system for handling all permits related to planning and the environment: 'Omgevingsloket online'. Gartner later proclaimed this system as one of the most impressive IT-projects in the world. This track record also\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nresulted in the first attractive orders in the Financial Services market from, among others, Achmea and Interpolis.\\n\\nAt the start of 2008, the Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Department chose the Be Informed Product Suite as the heart of its new information system.\\n\\nIn 2009 Be Informed was awarded its first million euro license contract with CAK to automate the Law for Contributions to people with Long Lasting Disabilities (in Dutch: WTCG).\\n\\nOur first multimillion euro contract was closed in 2010 with the Land Registry / Public Records Office (in Dutch: Kadaster).

Use Case Description:\\n\\nLG CNS created this solution to manage the complete electric battery life cycle and to optimize battery usage, exchange time, and market value. This provides meaningful data on how EV batteries are performing during live operations, and depending on environmental characteristics like temperature, humidity, road conditions, driver behavior, etc. The project is a joint venture between LG CNS (Planning this project / Data analysis to generate the meaningful business data), 4Dream (Edge device design including Hardware and Software), Charzin (EV charging company like ChargePoint), MinTech (AI company specializing in EV batteries and ESS), iBEX (Specialized in electric parts for Edge device) and Vantiq (platform for battery service project both in Cloud and Edge).\\n\\n## b. Why Vantiq:\\n\\nLG CNS had tried to build the system using AWS and found that they could not scale past 100 vehicles. To achieve their goal of scaling to hundreds of thousands of vehicles, they decided to rearchitect the system with Vantiq to enable real-time processing of large amounts of battery data on edge devices in the vehicle, without the need for cloud communication. AWS edge services (as well as Azure) are not made for environments like a small edge device on the car, as they require a configured server (like a mini cloud environment).\\n\\n## c. Development Details:\\n\\nCurrently in development with target completion by end of this year. At least 15 people from 7 companies are working together to complete all elements of the project including hardware, sensors, AI, and software:\\n\\nLG CNS: 1-2 data scientist and PM\\n\\nVantiq: 1-2 developers\\n\\nPartner: 3 - 4 each from 4Dream, MinTec, Charzin, and iBEX\\n\\n## d. Integrations with hardware, services, and external systems:\\n\\n- \u221e Big Data analytics system of LG CNS for Machine Learning\\n- \u221e Vehicle diagnostic systems\\n- \u221e Public bus operation system, long-term rental car system, EV car charging system, Gov't service system and Insurance company system\\n- \u221e Edge devices in EVs and (soon) with local Telco's MECs\\n\\n## e. Long-term vision:\\n\\nThis is a very strategic project for LG CNS with executive sponsorship directly from CEO. They want to be agnostic to all EV batteries and manufacturers so this can apply to all electric vehicle manufacturers including Cars, Buses, Bikes, Scooters, and Drones. LG CNS and the partner group are interested in expanding to other markets and regions that could also benefit from a real-time battery management solution. The agility of Vantiq enables flexible adaptation to other batteries systems, and to apply different rules depending on the environment or the customer needs.\\n\\n## f. Customer Testimonial:\\n\\nNew production laws in Korea require battery manufacturers to take ownership of the whole battery production process, from creation to recycling. This means that there is a lot of pressure to create highly scalable and reliable battery monitoring systems to get better performance out of the vehicles and better visibility into the system. LG CNS is extremely happy to have found Vantiq as the agile software foundation to enable this solution and easily expand the capabilities as new technology or sensors are added.\\n\\nNDA Required - This information is Proprietary and Confidential\\n\\n<!-- image -->\", \"file_path\": \"/var/graphrag/tennants/gil_fernandes/lightrag/clustre_full/input/clustre/Member firm materials/Vantiq/Vantiq-Use-Case-Details.txt\"}, {\"id\": 4, \"content\": \"Social Security Administrations in Curacao and St. Maarten. 2011 was also the year that Be Informed started its international expansion into the US and UK markets.\\n\\nDespite tough economic times and severe public sector budget cuts Be Informed was able to maintain its growth rate during 2012.

License fees in that period typically ranged from \u20ac50K to \u20ac100K per year. In 2009 we made a strategic decision to positioning our software as an enterprise wide business process platform for business critical processes. Operating in the core of our customers business allowed us to charge for substantially higher license fees (million euro plus). As a result of this decision we experienced longer sales cycles resulting in various deals shifting from 2010 to 2011. That is the main reason for the relatively low sales growth in 2010.\\n\\nIn 2011 we made the strategic decision to invest domain specific business solutions on top of our business process platform.

The ROI of the project needs to support the effort involved to create the architectural solution and to secure the necessary approvals from cyber security and data teams to host data on the external cloud.\\n\\nOther considerations such as the classification of the data and the firm\u2019s risk appetite need to be considered within the context of cloud hosting in addition to the presence of any sensitive information. For instance, equipping a Chatbot which uses external cloud hosting to know who it is talking to, and where they are, may require it know PII about the person asking the question and the location in which they work.\\n\\nIn assessing the potential benefits of a specific Chatbot deployment, Gareth focused on four questions:\\n\\n- How much time are people currently spending looking for answers in this area?\\n- How much time are subject matter experts spending providing these answers?\\n- How much value is attached to getting these answers right (e.g. in terms of risk)?\\n- Are there any factors on the horizon which could negate the need for the Chatbot, i.e. how future-proof is the use-case?\\n\\n**Creating the \u201cbot of bots\u201d and enterprise bot management**\\n\\nGareth highlighted that as larger organisations deploy more and more conversational AI solutions and see traffic flow through these solutions, the benefits start to materialise. However, new challenges can also emerge and new innovative solutions are required to meet them. For instance, the existence of multiple chatbots available to staff within a large global organisation provides benefits but also raises questions such as \u2018where can I find a Chatbot\u2019 and \u2018how do I select the one I actually need?\u2019 This is especially the case where companies use a variety of differing Chatbot architectures.\\n\\nWhat was needed was a \u201cbot of bots\u201d to create an ecosystem of bots and help to guide the employee easily to the right Chatbot:\\n\\n- The solution would need the ability to orchestrate effectively across multiple underlying SME Chatbots in a secure fashion\\n- It would also need to be able to communicate across a variety of different Chatbot architectures from AWS to GCP to On Premise Chatbot solutions\\n- Finally, the solution needed to be performant and compliant with HSBC\u2019s stringent cyber-security requirements.\\n\\nTo address this requirement for a \u201cbot-of-bots\u201d and a safe, consistent way to deploy bots operationally in HSBC, Gareth worked with Google Cloud Platform and with Filament and their Enterprise Bot Manager \u2013 an enterprise grade bot management platform which uses Google Kubernetes Engine to orchestrate and connect with multiple underlying Bot architectures.\\n\\n**Lessons learned from AiDA \u2013 HSBC\u2019s customer facing Chatbot in the US**\\n\\nFilament had gained separate experience working with HSBC on AiDA (Automated Immediate Digital Assistant), the Chatbot which provides the first level of customer interaction on HSBC\u2019s US website.\\n\\nClaire Fletcher-Hobbs from Filament added that AiDA has delivered great results so far, cutting the average enquiry handling time in half, increasing the percentage of enquiries resolved in the first interaction and delivering comparable levels of customer satisfaction.\\n\\nSome of the lessons learned from the development of AiDA are to:\\n\\n- Start with the basic things \u2013 questions that are frequently asked and relatively straight forward to resolve. These are the easiest to train the Chatbot and provide immediate productivity benefits.\\n- Spend enough time on the conversational interface design and don\u2019t be afraid of using buttons to guide customers through the conversation.\\n- Ensure, where the Chatbot cannot understand or adequately respond, it fails gracefully and hands-over seamlessly to a human agent (e.g. \u201clet me pass you to the right person to answer your question\u201d).\\n- Anticipate that the bot will be in its infancy when first deployed, so make sure the resources are in place to support and train the bot, otherwise it may be overwhelmed by the unexpected.\\n- Start measuring the benefits (e.g. productivity improvement) immediately but remember that these benefits may be low to begin with and grow over time, as the Chatbot is trained and becomes more effective in the answers it provides.\\n- Understand that, although the initial implementation effort can be significant (especially given the need for extensive pre-deployment vetting) the eventual running costs can be very low indeed, as they leverage the economics of the cloud service providers.\\n\\n**Looking ahead, how can even more value be delivered by chatbots**\\n\\nThe early benefits from Chatbot deployment in the Risk function have been targeted at productivity improvement and the creation of capacity among the subject matter expert community. Chatbots never sleep, provide business intelligence and enable the reprioritisation of work.\\n\\nThese benefits are further increased by the positive feedback loop created by using machine learning to leverage the wealth of data created by the bots themselves; each interaction is fed into a data-lake and this data is analysed to identify areas where processes can be changed or better information provided to reduce or eliminate repeated enquiries.\\n\\nChatbot technology is already capable of using API\u2019s to interface with other systems, either to get the information needed to answer a question or to trigger an action in response to a request. The next step may be to go beyond \u201chere\u2019s the answer to your question\u201d to \u201chere\u2019s what I\u2019ve done for you\u201d. In other words, integrating chatbots with robotic process automation.\\n\\nAnother significant advantage of chatbots over, say, intranet knowledge sharing, is the level of employee engagement they generate.

Is the corporation's needs aligned with those of their customers' when it comes to re-engineering customer services? Most companies recognise the value of an improved customer journey but too often service re-design has become code for cost-reduction .\\n\\nAI promises a new future, but many of the technologies have become hyped and results have been very uneven.\\n\\nAccording to Forrester Research, it turns out that there is common ground between the needs of enterprise and the desires of their customers. Most of us want the ability to solve our own problems on-line, but with the fall-back of human support when we need it. Perhaps the IVRs and long waiting times on hold have made us crave an intuitive self-serve experience where we can rapidly resolve our issue ourselves when we can't sleep at 3am.\\n\\nEnterprises want the same. They want us to self-serve on-line to resolve our own issues, and if we really need support to use chat. It's logical to see why they don't want us to call in to a contact centre with cost per call often topping \u00a35 a go.\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming this space, but many technologies have failed to deliver on some big promises made.\\n\\nThere is no technology today that enables you to wave a magic wand over unstructured data, say a company's existing 7,000 FAQs, and get ordered logic that can enable an AI to take over from a human knowledge worker. Machine learning techniques require large amounts of prior data to work from and even then it is difficult to trust the results because the technology is unable to articulate why or how any particular assertion has been reached.\\n\\nSo businesses revert to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) driven by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and create decision tree-based troubleshooting guides. These methods continue to be popular because they are accessible to business people and require little software engineering. That at least is a good thing. Too many knowledge engineering projects fail because the business experts and the software engineers are not interested in each others domains, and knowledge is diluted in the encoding process.\\n\\nBut here is the problem. Search , however powerful, combined with static content is not enough. It does not lead to a consultation with the customer and so requires the customer to do the legwork. If you ask Google a question, you get a fantastic list of\\n\\nresults back again. Happy reading! Google does not ask you a question back again. It is not consultative.\\n\\nDecision trees are consultative, but each tree starts from a single question, so you need to build lots of them. They are expensive to build, difficult to maintain and do not scale well. Knowledge is often repeated in multiple decision trees which is highly inefficient. They can quickly get large and actually end up holding an impressive amount of data, but much of this is accessible only by starting with the original question and is inaccessible when trying to solve other problems. The structure is one dimensional and too limiting.\\n\\n## Are we expecting too much?\\n\\nSpeaking personally, I expect my service providers to remember what I tell them and to learn about me through our interactions. If I choose to identify myself with my account number, I want the company to have immediate total recall and provide a high level of continuity in the service they provide, based on all of our previous engagements.\\n\\nI want the service to be joined-up regardless of the channel through which I am engaging and regardless of who I am talking to. If I go from reading an FAQ on a website into a chat session, I want the person I am chatting with to preempt my needs based on the FAQ I was reading. When I go from chat to a phone call, I want the agent to pick up from where I left off on the chat. I do not want to start again and I never want to be handed off to a colleague.\\n\\nI want my problem fixed first time so I don't have to explain my problem again and again.\\n\\nHow demanding am I?\\n\\nDo we have the technology today to create this utopia?\\n\\nYes, you can build a system like this today, powered by technologies like Rainbird but there is work to do. Let me explain...\\n\\nRemember there are no magic wands, so it remains necessary to build Knowledge Maps that describe what your best human knowledge workers know about your business and how it should be run. In any business there is logic locked up in the heads of your best business people that cannot be replaced by machine learning pointing at even your best unstructured data. Of course the process of knowledge encoding need not be all hard graft. Assistive techniques such as entity extraction can help do much of the heavy lifting, but an investment of time is required if your project is to be successful. It will not happen by magic, not yet.\\n\\nIf you seek to use AI to gain new efficiencies, deliver an improved augmented service or innovate new business, you need to invest time in modelling what your best people do today. There is so much hype around AI that this critical part of the jigsaw is given insufficient time. One of the reasons is because most AI technologies are accessible only to software engineers.\\n\\nRainbird enables business people to do this knowledge modelling visually in a way that quickly feels intuitive.\\n\\nI work with organisations who are looking to innovate through technology adoption. When I provide advice to my clients, I look at the data I have available, reflect back on all of my historic experiences and I join the dots. This leads me to a number of possible recommendations. I iterate over these, weigh up all of the information carefully until I reach a judgement in which I will hold a certain level of confidence. If I have a low level of confidence, I may give no advice at all and will simply ask for more data. If I am certain of my ground, I will share my advice with any caveats.\\n\\nRainbird works in the same way, and that is why\", \"file_path\": \"/var/graphrag/tennants/gil_fernandes/lightrag/clustre_full/input/clustre/Member firm materials/Rainbird/AI_and_Customer_Service.txt\"}, {\"id\": 7, \"content\": \"Freshfields, Clifford Chance, DLA Norton Rose firms, where the fee income at least of, uh, uh, hundreds of millions of pounds, probably over a billion.

But it's really big law where AI's merits are being evangelized most vocally and the most groundbreaking advances with AI are being made. It's worth noting even here that there's quite a lot of innovation theater going down. Firms can be clever today with their comms about what's just around the corner tomorrow. And I think ally in law also sort of signals that, that, that people overestimate change short term and underestimated long term. But if you look at where big law makes its money, it's in the large m and a financing property and litigation matters with teams of tens or hundreds of lawyers, the land of the classic law firm pyramid, but even the highest level of work has standardizable repeatable componentry, whether it's due diligence in m and a and financing property reports on title or electronic discovery litigation. And it's here that you can see AI in the longer run making a big impression on how the work's done. And also more importantly, perhaps how that change will affect law firms themselves. And I'll read a bit from Magic Circle firm Alan and ov his press release about its cooperation with the AI platform Harvey. So it said, Harvey's a platform that uses natural language processing, machine learning and data and analytics to automate and enhance various aspects of legal work such as contract analysis, due diligence, litigation and regulatory compliance. Whilst the output needs careful review by an a o lawyer, Harvey can help generate insights, recommendations, and predictions based on large volumes of data, enabling lawyers to deliver faster, smarter, and more cost effective solutions to their clients. And, and that's the goal, I mean, quite how it'll, uh, help cut out costs, uh, remains to be seen. But if you can sort of take a typical due diligence in an m and a probably accounts for 30 to 40% of the law firm's fees on a deal on average. And you can see AI giving the general counsel more choice on how to conduct that diligence, could get all the targets, lower level contracts and commitments reviewed by the AI and reported on the next level up, reviewed, say, by an outsourcing firm in a lower cost jurisdiction. The next level up by the law firm that's acting on the deal and the top level contracts by the GCs team. The point really here is that the GC will be able to calibrate by perceived risk who does what in the ecosystem. And lower transaction costs may mean more deals. For example, the business can run a slide rule over more potential targets. In due course we will see AI being able to prepare pretty decent diligence reports, draft integration reports, going onto the next step and maybe even benchmarking your acquisition against similar deals in the same industry. That changes the relationship between the GC and the law firm, probably putting more control in the GCs hands, and it's also gonna contribute to reducing the need for more junior professionals shrinking the base, narrowing the base of the law firm pyramid, which will have an impact on the structure and economics of law going forward. So ju just quickly about contention and legal concern, uh, you know, nothing has stopped or even dented the rise of the law firm over the last 50 years. It's just an amazing success story. And tech up to now, which has disrupted other sectors has just been a boon for lawyers. But you have to wonder whether AI's capacity to remove the need for certain types of work would change the dynamics of legal practice. In terms of legal concerns. And this is something that we'll be looking at a bit later. In a world where there's just a frantic amount of data and tech regulation hitting the statute books, how AI will get dealt with has to be a source of concern. Um, I'm not not qualified to speak on the singularity and existential threat, but that aside the key legal areas are, you know, first, how deep should regulation go? Is it right to grade AI formulaically by reference to today's level of risk? How dynamic should it be? Do you have x anti or ex post regulation? And aside from those questions, there's quite a lot of regulation there already. Issues around bias and discrimination, regulating privacy and personal data, which is really where the action is. Loads of questions here. Is your L l M or foundation model GDP are cleared? What about regimes in other parts of the world and alignment geographically? What about the other data sets you are using? Intellectual property, Getty images, suing for copyright infringement of their pictures, AWS people uploading confidential information and then getting it back from the ai. You know, how can you possibly clear all IP rights in an l l m?

Solutions can be created by combining independent generic models to create unique solutions. Solutions can be easily extended and adapted by adding customer specific constraints. Thus preventing the 'one size fits all' pitfall associated with conventional solutions based on generic process models.\\n\\n## Characteristics:\\n\\n- \u00b7 Out-of-the-box configuration\\n- \u00b7 Highly adjustable within model framework\\n- \u00b7 Industry solutions through standard models\\n\\n## Advantages:\\n\\n- \u00b7 Standard and fit\\n- \u00b7 Quickly adaptable\\n- \u00b7 Low TCO, high agility\\n\\n## Disadvantages:\\n\\n- \u00b7 More conceptual approach\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Combining generic models to unique solutions\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nThe constraints based approach is superior to flow-based formalisms, where order relations between activities prevent proper reuse of flow based models.\\n\\n## Developing business solutions\\n\\nDeveloping business solutions is all about capturing business knowledge in models.
