It provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. AWS serves both innovators and incumbents with a broad suite of services and is a top search term among learners. It is used as a backend for software architectures and web applications, specifically for Lambdas and databases, and enables dynamic scaling of resources in the cloud. AWS is interested in the capability to change the performance of various sensors on board a distant vessel or system and provides the cloud infrastructure that enables Alexa to process requests quickly. AltViz adheres to AWS's security best practices and suggests AWS for deploying intelligent applications and the AltViz Platform.\\n\\nAWS has a region in Switzerland and has collaborated with organizations to build cloud-native backend infrastructure, such as for the Test and Trace app. Zuhlke partners with AWS, having 60 certified specialists, and has developed hosting, network, and governance strategies for AWS, offering deeper native cloud service integration than Samsung SDS. AWS has also constructed a private cloud for the CIA and SIS. The MoD Cloud Platform is based on AWS. HSBC Global Risk utilizes AWS for chatbot technology, and AWS offers chatbot architectures. Clients include Rivian, Honda, BMW, and VW. Skillsoft provides resources for AWS exam preparation. Vyntelligence is an AWS partner with Energy Competency Status. AWS collaborates with Zuhlke on a global scale to help energy companies plan and deliver their change programmes and optimise costs. ThoughtMachine runs the core banking solution for Mox on AWS. Smart421 partners with AWS to deliver end-to-end cloud solutions, but also competes with AWS, primarily offering consulting and SaaS services.\\n\\nAWS is a hyperscaler that offers first generation software development products. LG CNS initially tried to use AWS but found it could not scale sufficiently for their vehicle monitoring system. Despite being a major provider with a significant market share used by both enterprises and smaller organizations, AWS has experienced outages affecting services like Vine and Instagram, raising concerns about potential downtime. There are also potential data security issues related to AI and the inadvertent uploading of confidential information to AWS, which could be accessible by AI systems. An open AWS bucket was found downloading and running arbitrary code within a wrapper during process execution. Currently, AWS is experiencing high levels of engagement and excitement in generative AI. AWS is listed as #6 and is also mentioned as a vendor that uses tools to resell other capabilities. Its real-time reference architectures are contrasted with Vantiq's approach.\\n<SEP>Amazon Web Services, a cloud platform used for the Disaster Recovery solution, including Oracle databases, Active

With the win of the two major government contracts awarded in the BeNeLux, Be Informed was able to reinforce its position as market leader for the public sector. The multi million euro contracts with the European Patent Office and UWV were won against severe competition from all the major players: SAP, Oracle, Pega systems, Microsoft, IBM. In both tender procedures Be Informed was able to prove the superiority of its technology.\\n\\nAlso in 2012 we continued our international expansion with establishing legal entities in both the US and the UK market, opening up the Turkish market and building a partner network in the UK, US, Turkey and the Nordics.\\n\\nIn the 2013 we saw continued international growth with contract wins at Proctor &amp; Gamble, Navy Federal and Blue Cross Blue Shield in the US; the Office of Harmonization of the Internal Market in Spain, L'easy in Denmark, City of London Police in the UK, Aegon in Turkey and BIKO in Kazakhstan.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nAlso in 2013 we established formal partnerships with ATOS Origin for smart cities, CACI for the US federal government, Sopra, Northgate and Coactive for the UK government and CGI for the Intellectual Property domain.\\n\\nSince its establishment Be Informed has enjoyed a substantial string of successes resulting in a year-over-year growth of over 50%. Two major strategic decisions are reflected in the development of Be Informed's turnover.\\n\\nUntil 2009 Be Informed sold its software primarily for small to medium sized complex / knowledge intensive applications with corresponding license fees. License fees in that period typically ranged from \u20ac50K to \u20ac100K per year. In 2009 we made a strategic decision to positioning our software as an enterprise wide business process platform for business critical processes. Operating in the core of our customers business allowed us to charge for substantially higher license fees (million euro plus). As a result of this decision we experienced longer sales cycles resulting in various deals shifting from 2010 to 2011. That is the main reason for the relatively low sales growth in 2010.\\n\\nIn 2011 we made the strategic decision to invest domain specific business solutions on top of our business process platform. The investment in business solutions was aimed at:\\n\\n- \uf0b7 shortening sales cycles, while improving success rates.\\n- \uf0b7 improving scalability of both the sales and implementation capability (internal staff plus leveraging partners).\\n- \uf0b7 reducing implementation risk.\\n\\nThe following business solutions are under development:\\n\\nFor the public sector:\\n\\n- \uf0b7 Multi Tax Solution\\n- \uf0b7 Multi Benefit Solution\\n- \uf0b7 Multi Permit Solution\\n- \uf0b7 Public Safety and Security Solution\\n- \uf0b7 Intellectual property (together with EPO)\\n\\nFor the financial services sector we are developing:\\n\\n- \uf0b7 Solution for online advice, sales and underwriting\\n- \uf0b7 Solution for online claims handling\\n- \uf0b7 Governance Risk and Compliance\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Organizational development\\n\\nDuring 2012 Be Informed has made considerable investments in its ability to cope with rapid growth in customers and partners, not only in the Netherlands, but all over the globe.

We also tripled our sales force (from 6 to 18 people). An International Business Group has been put into place to develop business in new countries and manage worldwide partnerships with organizations like Microsoft, CGI and Atos Origin.\\n\\nVertical market teams for Public Sector and Financial Services have been established. They are responsible for developing and marketing our domain specific solutions on a global scale.\\n\\nThe professional services department invested in people, methodologies and tools to be able to support customers and partners across the globe. The Academy invested in training courses, training materials and trainers to be able to train large numbers of partners and customers. Other investment include:\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nlanguage skills of our services and support staff, opening hours of the helpdesk and an online knowledge base (Insight) to reduce the learning curves for Be Informed specialists.\\n\\nFinally, over the last four years, Be Informed invested over 15 million euro in the development of Be Informed version 4. Be Informed version 4 is specifically developed to facilitate the international roll-out of our software.\\n\\n## Crossing the Chasm\\n\\nBusiness solutions have allow Be Informed to address a completely different segment of the market. Like any other relatively young organization with breakthrough technology, Be Informed had to market its technology to innovative CIO's. Visionaries willing to take a risk and try innovative approaches to solving complex problems or creating competitive advantage.\\n\\nWith business solutions we can sell to business owners with broken processes, who want to use the business solution to improve their operations.

And how does that operate? That mean that's real edge device operation. It's away from normal communications for quite long periods of time. Well, the way it operates is there is an edge device on board the vessel that monitors both the condition of the vessel itself, so how much power it's got, the status of the systems on board, if it's leaking, all that sort of thing. It monitors also all of the data that's gathered by the submarine while it's under the water. So what the video sees, what its other sensor see, so temperature, salinity and some of the machines on board that do physical jobs from the submarine. So all that is monitored and passed to the edge system that is on board the autonomous sub. When the subsurface all that information fully backed up is squirted back to an op room. Op room can decide what to do and then it gives new instructions back to the submarine. Now those might be instructions such as go and look at this bit of cable, go and look at that bit of bit underwater infrastructure, or it could be subtle changes to how sensors and other systems are operating on board. And it is a really important aspect of edge computing that you can change the performance of various sensors on board a distant vessel or system. So that could be a satellite. AWS is very interested in that capability or that could be a drone that's flying around in the air where you can remission it in flight or that could be a subsurface vessel like we're talking about where you can remission it when it surfaces and change the programming of a number of sensors board. We might wanna come back to that one because that's a important capability for later on. The next one, and this is very much a, a smart X one is SoftBank's headquarters, um, which is out in Tokyo. Uh, top Sheba building. It's really more of an estate, a smart estate rather than a smart building. Um, relies heavily on edge computing capability. And what would I say about that? Well, the first thing I would say is the initial effort to do this, um, received a lot of problems. It were faced a lot of problems and uh, Azure were asked to create this capability and this capability required the harmonization of 1400 different sensor systems and seven AI systems to work together as one and do what they wanted them to do. Unfortunately, the project failed twice. It took 18 months and required 15 people and never succeeded. Edge devices were brought in to replace the approach that was being taken by, um, the, the vendor who was trying to do it. And Microsoft, if you like, moved on and were replaced by an edge deliverer that took about six months, someone and a half people to deliver the kind of capabilities required. But what were those capabilities? Well, I'll give you an example. There are several here, but I'll give you an example. The kind capabilities we're talking about are being able to walk in through the front door of a bank, clearly a sensitive piece of infrastructure for your face to be scanned by, uh, a video provider for it to be identified that it's you by, uh, video and ai and then for the edge provider to decide to immediately open the door and let you in. Now, if all that information from the video analytics and from the AI system was getting streamed back to the cloud and then back to a gate to open the gate, the latency would be significant and the gate wouldn't open on time, system wouldn't work. That was the kind of problem that was being faced by a Azure when they were trying to solve this issue edge, not a problem to solve. Taking that to the next stage within the building. There's several other examples of Comput computer vision and video systems linked up again to an AI system that are looking around for things like people lying on the floor. So people collapsed, looking for fires, looking for firearms, looking for fights, anything that affects the safety and security of the back. But if the AI believes seen something like this through the video system, it will then pass it to the edge system who may well say, well go back and have a look in another hundredth of second, another turn of the second in five seconds, it will turn other sensors onto what is happening. And if it decides it's real, like it's a real fire or somebody has actually collapsed on the floor as opposed to is picking up their pen, it will automatically, without speaking to a human alert, a security guard or alert the fire service or alert one of the emergency procedures within the building structure. So the whole thing can function a lot more quickly and can double check by adding information to the original detection what is actually happening. So rather than you just having a sensor going off because it's seen something, you can add layers of information to this to decide what you're going to do next. So SoftBank, uh, was a massive success and they are running an edge system right now, uh, covering all of those sort of things. Access, transport, shopping, cleaning and delivery and delivery, believe it or not, is by them flying drones around inside the building and dropping off documents and other bits and pops, including your lunch, uh, inside the building, which can be, um, a little bit strange, but they, uh, there we go. And so as you see, 1400 sensors and seven AI systems all sequenced up for that. Next one is interesting, ev battery management. Um, so the issue around this was, uh, LG had tried to come up with a smart battery management system for, um, a whole new generation of autonomous vehicles, but the problem was they couldn't actually get beyond monitoring the condition of a hundred vehicles.

The worldwide software market is estimated at $450 billion, the computer software market for government and financial services is estimated at $120 billion and still growing by 4 - 5 % per year.\\n\\nComputer software spending includes the total value of purchased or leased packaged software such as operating systems, database systems, programming tools, utilities, and applications. It excludes expenditures for internal software development and outsourced custom software development.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## ICT spending by industry segment\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nSource: Digital Planet 2010, The World Information Technology and Services Alliance\\n\\nThe addressable software license market for Be Informed is a subset of the computer software market. We have estimated the addressable market for license revenue by calculating the potential public sector license revenue per country in Europe and extrapolated this for the rest of the world.\\n\\n## Market Segmentation\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nSource: Be Informed\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nBe Informed segments the market in three tiers, based on size of the customer organization. The license potential for the European public sector market is calculated using our standard price mechanism.\\n\\n- \uf0b7 In tier 1: We see an average of 12 to 15 relevant central agencies for our business solution  per European country. 2 Applying our standard price mechanism would yield a market of \u20ac 2,2 billion\\n- \uf0b7 In tier 2: Total market size is similar as tier 1, but divided over more, but smaller agencies.\\n- \uf0b7 In tier 3: Based on individual business cases and in close cooperation with local partners. We foresee an equal market size as tier 1.\\n\\nThis calculation leads up to an annual market size of circa \u20ac 6,5 billion for public sector in Europe. The financial services market is of similar size. Europe represents roughly 1/3 of the IT spent in the world. This would lead to a market estimate of \u20ac 39 billion.\\n\\nCompare: Analyst firm Forrester estimates the market for smart process apps at $34 Billion by 2015. Smart process apps are a new category of business application software designed to support processes that are people-intensive, highly variable, loosely structured, and subject to frequent change. Smart process apps are 1) designed for people and 2) built for continuous change: typical Be Informed applications.\\n\\nAs a consequence we estimate the total addressable market for Be Informed at between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac40 billion euro . 3\\n\\n2 The five solutions we currently pursue are: permits, benefits, tax, registrations  and criminal justice.   Permits are applied in several domains: planning &amp; environment, immigration, labor &amp; economic affairs, etc. The same applies to Benefits (healthcare, social security, student loans, rural payments, etc.), Registrations (intellectual property, land &amp; property, vehicles, companies, persons, etc. and criminal justice (police, prosecution, courts, prison,  rehabilitation, etc)\\n\\n3 This is excluding complex, heavily regulated processes in other industries like new product introductions for fast-moving consumer goods, food, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, intellectual property protection processes or the healthcare market.

This service was supplied to a large number of government departments (Education, Culture and Science (OCW), Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM), Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK), The Tax Administration, Customs and a number of e-government programs.\\n\\nIn 2007, another breakthrough came with the award of a contract for a nationwide system for handling all permits related to planning and the environment: 'Omgevingsloket online'.

Among enterprises that offer a self-service cloud portal, 80 percent can provision cloud workloads in less than an hour, double the 40 percent that could meet that standard in 2014.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nWhile central IT is seeking to take the reins by bringing cloud services into the enterprise, cloud governance has remained stuck in neutral during the past year. A majority of enterprises are still missing critical elements of cloud governance, including a defined portfolio of cloud providers; guidelines on which applications should migrate to cloud; cloud SLA and disaster recovery policies; and basic approval policies. Enterprises made some progress implementing cost controls for cloud, with 34 percent now having defined cost policies, up from 29 percent in 2014.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## DevOps rises; Docker soars.\\n\\nSince the advent of AWS in 2006, cloud and DevOps have become inextricably intertwined. For many organizations, the use of cloud infrastructure is a critical pillar to support the continuous integration and delivery cycles and release cycles that DevOps helps to drive.\\n\\nThe 2015 survey results shows continued growth in DevOps adoption, up to 66 percent from 6 percent in 2014. Enterprises, often seeking greater agility amid the complexity that comes with their larger size, show even greater DevOps usage (71 percent) vs. SMBs (63 percent).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nAs DevOps has grown, the set of available tools has also expanded. DevOps teams are often leveraging automated configuration management tools - such as Chef, Puppet, Salt, and Ansible. In the last year, Docker, a container-based approach, has also stormed onto the scene as another way to deploy code assets on infrastructure. All of these tools are often used in conjunction with cloud management solutions that provision infrastructure across clouds.\\n\\nWith a significant head start, Chef (28 percent) and Puppet (24 percent) remain the most used DevOps tools overall. However, Docker, in just its first year on the market, is already being used by 13 percent of organizations. Even more impressively, more than a third (35 percent) of respondents report plans to use Docker.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nAmong enterprises, Puppet is used most frequently (36 percent) followed by Chef (32 percent) and Docker (14 percent). SMBs chose Chef more often (26 percent) followed by Puppet (19 percent) and Docker (13 percent).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Cloud benefits and cloud challenges evolve.\\n\\nIn 2015, the benefits that respondents experienced using cloud increased across the board. The top three benefits - scalability, faster access to infrastructure, and availability - are the same in 2015, but in each case these benefits were cited by more respondents.\\n\\nIn addition, the 2015 survey echoes a key finding of the 2014 State of the Cloud Report: cloud maturity matters. As organizations adopt cloud more broadly, they realize increasingly more value, and the challenges of adopting cloud decline.\\n\\nIn 2015, some of the largest growth in reported benefits were financial related. For example, moving CapEx to OpEx was reported as a benefit by 38 percent (up from 28 percent in 2014). IT staff efficiency was reported by 41 percent (up from 33 percent in 2014) and cost savings was reported by 39 percent (up from 34 percent in 2014).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nThere were also significant increases in several specific areas of cloud challenges. As cloud adoption expands and companies progress further in their cloud journeys, the competition for scarce cloud expertise has increased. As a result, lack of cloud resources and expertise is now reported as a significant challenge by 27 percent of respondents vs. 17 percent in 2014 - making it the second most common challenge after security.\\n\\nThe other challenge that was reported more frequently is managing multiple cloud services (25 percent in 2015 vs. 18 percent in 2014). As companies expand their cloud footprints and their portfolio of cloud services, they often struggle to gain visibility, automation, and governance across all of their cloud providers. To help companies address these challenges, we've identified key steps and provided a roadmap for success in The Definitive Guide to Cloud Portfolio Management .\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Top 5 Challenges Change with Cloud Maturity\\n\\nSource: RightScale 2015 State of the Cloud Report\\n\\n## Increasing Competition in Cloud\\n\\nAfter many new cloud providers entered the market in 2013, we've now started to see the dust settle and get a better view of the competitive landscape. Over the last 12 months, we've begun to get a picture of how public cloud offerings from Microsoft and Google are faring as well as the rebranded vCloud Air from VMware. On the private cloud front, VMware and OpenStack continue to evolve their offerings while Microsoft introduced Azure Pack, which creates Azure cloud APIs on top of Microsoft-based private clouds.\\n\\nWe asked respondents to tell us which clouds they were using and whether they were running applications in the cloud, experimenting with the cloud, planning to use the cloud, or had no plans to use the cloud. As cited earlier, most enterprises are using more than one cloud, so totals will add up to more than 100 percent. These results indicate whether a respondent is using any cloud, but do not specify the number of applications that are running in each cloud.\\n\\n## AWS still dominates in public cloud; Azure makes inroads among enterprises.\\n\\nNo surprise: AWS continues to lead overall in public cloud adoption, with 57 percent of respondents currently running applications in AWS, up from 54 percent in 2014. This continues to be more than 4x the adoption rate of the closest competitor.
