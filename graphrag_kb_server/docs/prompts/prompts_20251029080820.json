It provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. AWS serves both innovators and incumbents with a broad suite of services and is a top search term among learners. It is used as a backend for software architectures and web applications, specifically for Lambdas and databases, and enables dynamic scaling of resources in the cloud. AWS is interested in the capability to change the performance of various sensors on board a distant vessel or system and provides the cloud infrastructure that enables Alexa to process requests quickly. AltViz adheres to AWS's security best practices and suggests AWS for deploying intelligent applications and the AltViz Platform.\\n\\nAWS has a region in Switzerland and has collaborated with organizations to build cloud-native backend infrastructure, such as for the Test and Trace app. Zuhlke partners with AWS, having 60 certified specialists, and has developed hosting, network, and governance strategies for AWS, offering deeper native cloud service integration than Samsung SDS. AWS has also constructed a private cloud for the CIA and SIS. The MoD Cloud Platform is based on AWS. HSBC Global Risk utilizes AWS for chatbot technology, and AWS offers chatbot architectures. Clients include Rivian, Honda, BMW, and VW. Skillsoft provides resources for AWS exam preparation. Vyntelligence is an AWS partner with Energy Competency Status. AWS collaborates with Zuhlke on a global scale to help energy companies plan and deliver their change programmes and optimise costs. ThoughtMachine runs the core banking solution for Mox on AWS. Smart421 partners with AWS to deliver end-to-end cloud solutions, but also competes with AWS, primarily offering consulting and SaaS services.\\n\\nAWS is a hyperscaler that offers first generation software development products. LG CNS initially tried to use AWS but found it could not scale sufficiently for their vehicle monitoring system. Despite being a major provider with a significant market share used by both enterprises and smaller organizations, AWS has experienced outages affecting services like Vine and Instagram, raising concerns about potential downtime. There are also potential data security issues related to AI and the inadvertent uploading of confidential information to AWS, which could be accessible by AI systems. An open AWS bucket was found downloading and running arbitrary code within a wrapper during process execution. Currently, AWS is experiencing high levels of engagement and excitement in generative AI. AWS is listed as #6 and is also mentioned as a vendor that uses tools to resell other capabilities. Its real-time reference architectures are contrasted with Vantiq's approach.\\n<SEP>Amazon Web Services, a cloud platform used for the Disaster Recovery solution, including Oracle databases, Active

Summary\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n**Are Chatbots the future interface for global business?**\\n\\nChatbots are positively transforming the way HSBC supports its people and customers. We were therefore delighted to welcome Gareth Butler, Senior Programme Manager/ Director, Global Risk Transformation and Innovation at HSBC, as the guest speaker for our first Breakfast Briefing of 2020.\\n\\nGareth brings more than 25 years\u2019 experience in customer-facing roles to the management of risk transformation and innovation. His remit covers a broad spectrum, including the application of AI, chatbots, data analysis, machine learning and behavioural analysis to the operational roles of the people in HSBC\u2019s Risk organisation.\\n\\nGareth shared HSBC\u2019s experience of harnessing chatbots to enable colleagues around the globe to get quicker answers to key policy questions and allow policy experts to work on higher value tasks. He also explained how HSBC Risk Transformation has fostered a culture of experimentation, where value is measured in terms of a wide range of benefits.\\n\\nHSBC has around 200 petabytes of data, 235,000 employees in 39,000 offices, 40 million customers, 90,000 servers and data centres in 21 countries. It also has over 200 Chatbots in development/production stage on a variety of infrastructures from on-premise architecture through to Cloud based solutions, in both staff and customer facing capacity.\\n\\nHSBC operates in a broad range of regulated markets and this scale and complexity brings with it challenges and also opportunities by creating a rich seedbed for experimentation and innovation.\\n\\n**Developing conversational interfaces for HSBC\u2019s risk function**\\n\\nConversational interfaces are not new to the market; they have been around, in one form or another, for many years. And they\u2019re here to stay. From early MIT based Bots in the 1960\u2019s to the current day with Alexa operating on more than 100 million devices and Siri on more than 500 million. Market commentators, for example Gartner, have previously predicted that in 2020 the average person may speak more with Chatbot mechanisms than they do with their spouse or partner and other commentators have predicted that Chatbots will become a primary mechanism for interfacing with customers across a wide range of industries.\\n\\nRobo-advice is establishing itself as one of the leading disruptive technologies in the business sector and there are several factors driving this trend:\\n\\n- Humans can be naturally inconsistent in the answers they give to similar questions \u2013 they may have different opinions or different ways of asking the same question. This can be more prevalent when there are lots of people who may ask or answer the same question or where the answer to the question is complex or open to wide interpretation.\\n- Chatbots provide consistent advice and can be trained in a controlled fashion to get smarter over time. They never sleep and operate 24/7/365\\n- Chatbots also generate business intelligence and analytics which can be used to take decisions, for example by highlighting what it is people are asking about, and where, and enabling the root cause underlying the question to be addressed more directly (thereby reducing the need for the question to be asked in the first place)\\n- And, of course, Chatbots can allow for the reprioritisation of work by reducing the workload of subject matter experts, freeing them up to work on more complicated and higher value problems and opportunities.\\n\\nWhen considering the merits of a use-case for a Chatbot initiative, it\u2019s key to narrow down the broad range of possible use-cases to those which offer the greatest range of potential benefits. A sophisticated cloud architecture design for conversational AI needs to be supported by a robust business case. For instance, targeting areas which receive tens of thousands of repeat queries every year may be more appropriate for the deployment of a complex architectural solution than a use-case with fewer than 1,000 queries per year.\\n\\nA variety of architectures and products are used within HSBC Global Risk for Chatbot Technology, including AWS and Google (on the Google Cloud Platform - GCP). Through Google, Gareth was introduced to Filament, who are experts in applied AI. They employ a team of 30+ data scientists and machine learning engineers who deliver scalable AI solutions for enterprise clients.\\n\\nWithin Global Risk at HSBC there is an established Innovation platform which encourages ideation, experimentation through proof of concepts and learning of new technologies. There is also a network of cloud sandbox and development environments within which to progress ideas from experiment to production stage. These environments have been put to good use to support the evolution of conversational AI solutions.\\n\\nSeveral of these experiments focused around the use of chatbots to ingest internal policies and surface pertinent aspects within them quickly to employees in response to specific questions through the Chatbot user interface. Gareth\u2019s team worked closely with internal and external Data Science and Dev Ops teams to get the best out of the tools available and tune their algorithms to deliver results in the most effective way.\\n\\nFor example, rewriting a document to enable a Chatbot to work with it, or simply having the Chatbot return a large section of a policy and ask the user to self-serve in response to a question, is not particularly helpful if the employee then has to trawl through the policy to find the specific answer to their specific question. So, HSBC developed a solution which ingested raw policy data and enabled the Chatbot to not just return the policy, but to draw out the actual clause relating to the specific question.\\n\\n**Selecting good candidate use-cases for Chatbot implementation**\\n\\nIn selecting suitable use-cases for Chatbot implementation, the first thing Gareth focused on was looking for areas that generated relatively high volumes of enquiries and were going to do so for the foreseeable future (there\u2019s no point in going to a lot of effort to develop a Chatbot to answer questions on a policy or procedure that is shortly to be replaced or potentially eliminated).\\n\\nThe second question was whether the use-case would fix an actual problem and deliver some real benefit (e.g. capacity savings and\", \"file_path\": \"/var/graphrag/tennants/gil_fernandes/lightrag/clustre_full/input/clustre/Event summaries/Breakfast seminars/Breakfast_briefing_#33_-_HSBC_and_Filament_Write-up.txt\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"content\": \"Social Security Administrations in Curacao and St. Maarten. 2011 was also the year that Be Informed started its international expansion into the US and UK markets.\\n\\nDespite tough economic times and severe public sector budget cuts Be Informed was able to maintain its growth rate during 2012. With the win of the two major government contracts awarded in the BeNeLux, Be Informed was able to reinforce its position as market leader for the public sector. The multi million euro contracts with the European Patent Office and UWV were won against severe competition from all the major players: SAP, Oracle, Pega systems, Microsoft, IBM. In both tender procedures Be Informed was able to prove the superiority of its technology.\\n\\nAlso in 2012 we continued our international expansion with establishing legal entities in both the US and the UK market, opening up the Turkish market and building a partner network in the UK, US, Turkey and the Nordics.\\n\\nIn the 2013 we saw continued international growth with contract wins at Proctor &amp; Gamble, Navy Federal and Blue Cross Blue Shield in the US; the Office of Harmonization of the Internal Market in Spain, L'easy in Denmark, City of London Police in the UK, Aegon in Turkey and BIKO in Kazakhstan.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nAlso in 2013 we established formal partnerships with ATOS Origin for smart cities, CACI for the US federal government, Sopra, Northgate and Coactive for the UK government and CGI for the Intellectual Property domain.\\n\\nSince its establishment Be Informed has enjoyed a substantial string of successes resulting in a year-over-year growth of over 50%. Two major strategic decisions are reflected in the development of Be Informed's turnover.\\n\\nUntil 2009 Be Informed sold its software primarily for small to medium sized complex / knowledge intensive applications with corresponding license fees. License fees in that period typically ranged from \u20ac50K to \u20ac100K per year. In 2009 we made a strategic decision to positioning our software as an enterprise wide business process platform for business critical processes. Operating in the core of our customers business allowed us to charge for substantially higher license fees (million euro plus). As a result of this decision we experienced longer sales cycles resulting in various deals shifting from 2010 to 2011. That is the main reason for the relatively low sales growth in 2010.\\n\\nIn 2011 we made the strategic decision to invest domain specific business solutions on top of our business process platform. The investment in business solutions was aimed at:\\n\\n- \uf0b7 shortening sales cycles, while improving success rates.\\n- \uf0b7 improving scalability of both the sales and implementation capability (internal staff plus leveraging partners).\\n- \uf0b7 reducing implementation risk.\\n\\nThe following business solutions are under development:\\n\\nFor the public sector:\\n\\n- \uf0b7 Multi Tax Solution\\n- \uf0b7 Multi Benefit Solution\\n- \uf0b7 Multi Permit Solution\\n- \uf0b7 Public Safety and Security Solution\\n- \uf0b7 Intellectual property (together with EPO)\\n\\nFor the financial services sector we are developing:\\n\\n- \uf0b7 Solution for online advice, sales and underwriting\\n- \uf0b7 Solution for online claims handling\\n- \uf0b7 Governance Risk and Compliance\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Organizational development\\n\\nDuring 2012 Be Informed has made considerable investments in its ability to cope with rapid growth in customers and partners, not only in the Netherlands, but all over the globe.

An International Business Group has been put into place to develop business in new countries and manage worldwide partnerships with organizations like Microsoft, CGI and Atos Origin.\\n\\nVertical market teams for Public Sector and Financial Services have been established. They are responsible for developing and marketing our domain specific solutions on a global scale.\\n\\nThe professional services department invested in people, methodologies and tools to be able to support customers and partners across the globe. The Academy invested in training courses, training materials and trainers to be able to train large numbers of partners and customers. Other investment include:\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nlanguage skills of our services and support staff, opening hours of the helpdesk and an online knowledge base (Insight) to reduce the learning curves for Be Informed specialists.\\n\\nFinally, over the last four years, Be Informed invested over 15 million euro in the development of Be Informed version 4. Be Informed version 4 is specifically developed to facilitate the international roll-out of our software.\\n\\n## Crossing the Chasm\\n\\nBusiness solutions have allow Be Informed to address a completely different segment of the market. Like any other relatively young organization with breakthrough technology, Be Informed had to market its technology to innovative CIO's. Visionaries willing to take a risk and try innovative approaches to solving complex problems or creating competitive advantage.\\n\\nWith business solutions we can sell to business owners with broken processes, who want to use the business solution to improve their operations.

While we have been skeptical of TSLA's valuation, at the same time its Silicon Valley start-up approach that brought a 'clean sheet' design to the design of the data and electrical system was a significant advancearguably as important as its powertrain  innovation.  These innovations, which Tesla owners take for granted (and most new entrant EV makers are targeting), include:\\n\\n- Frequent OTS updates for all aspects of vehicle software-not just infotainment but also \u00b7 safety features and driving controls;\\n- Ability to pipe data into the cloud; \u00b7\\n- One-screen control of dozens of vehicle functions-drive mode, trunk door opening, globe \u00b7 box opening, etc. with driver specific memory, as well as the ability to control these functions via an app (e.g., to preheat or pre-cool the interior); and\\n- During the chip supply shortage, the ability to swap out chipsets as the software has been \u00b7 abstracted from the hardware, which has helped Tesla keep production going as other automakers struggled to find replacement chips.\\n\\nUnlike other aspects of Musk's strategy (powertrain, limited number of models, bypassing dealers) we've yet to find a legacy OEM that doesn't see a need for frequent OTAs and better software.  Indeed, a software defined vehicle is key to monetizing recurring revenue streams from the vehicle.\\n\\nBut progress has been slow since we first wrote about the connected car in 2013, which in our view speaks to the enterprise transformation challenge of taking the 1990's era architecture of ~120-150 distributed electronic control units (ECUs) connected to a low-speed controlled area network (CAN) bus-not the modern, cloud-connected, high-powered processing world.\\n\\nBut with OEMs now committed to the transformation and building up their own IT staffs to create their own software stacks, which raises the issue of how tier ones and especially those with embedded software products fit into the evolution as well as the role of tech companies ranging from chip makers to software toolkit providers to cloud hosting services.\\n\\nIn this section, we'll describe:\\n\\n- What the legacy architecture is-and why it won't cut it going forward \u00b7\\n- What are the key elements of a software defined vehicle \u00b7\\n- Why it is not just a hardware/software shift, but also a cultural/organizational shift for legacy \u00b7 OEMs\\n\\nIn later sections, we will explore the emerging roles in the software defined vehicle infrastructure and the implications for OEMs (both legacy and new entrant digital natives), tier ones, tier-two chip suppliers, and other tech players.\\n\\n## Software defined vehicle features key to competitiveness, differentiation, and future revenue streams\\n\\nHistorically, competition in the showroom has been based on physical vehicle attributes such as styling, fuel economy, safety, and performance.  While to some extent that software was\\n\\nsupporting some of the features, e.g., fuel economy driven by computer-controlled precise fuel injection or anti-lock brakes controlled by a brake control unit, it was largely invisible to the driver.\\n\\nWhile we have been skeptical of the Tesla valuation, even as a bear, although at the same time a Tesla Model S owner, it's inarguable\", \"file_path\": \"/var/graphrag/tennants/gil_fernandes/lightrag/clustre_full/input/clustre/Member firm materials/Vantiq/The_software_defined_car.txt\"}, {\"id\": 6, \"content\": \"at a recent senior executive briefing hosted by Clustre, he explained how the challenge of dealing in highly regulated, global markets has created a rich seedbed for experimentation and innovation\u2026\\n\\n'Global Risk at HSBC has a well-established innovation platform that encourages ideation, experimentation and immersive exposure to new technologies. We also have an impressive network of cloud sandbox and development environments. These can speed ideas from experiment to proof of concept and then swiftly on to production stage. This has massively supported the evolution of conversational AI solutions'.\\n\\n## How digital assistants can optimise your customer and employee experience\\n\\nSeveral of these experiments have focused on developing digital assistants that can respond to very specific, complex questions from internal users. For example, one challenge was to create an interface that could ingest massive amounts of policy data and - on demand - intelligently source and select the precisely right mix of policy information.\\n\\n- 3. Start small and iterate. Begin by answering your two or three most common questions.\\n\\nWorking closely with Data Science, Dev Ops and Clustre's machine learning experts, the team delivered the bespoke solution. It can consume raw policy data and then use semantic, contextual intelligence to identify definitive clauses that answer very specific questions. The tedium-saving, job enrichment for front line and back-office staff has been substantial. This is not chatbot brutalism - this is a whole new generation of very clever, forensic digital assistants.\\n\\n## The\\tfive\\tessential\\tsteps\\tto\\tdigital\\tassistant success\\n\\nAs we emerge from this pandemic, we are being forced to exchange the confident certainties of our pre-Covid life for a complex, often threatening new world. We are all looking for clarity in a very confused landscape. But one reality is beyond all doubt. Digital - and especially digital assistants will play an extremely influential role in shaping our future. So, we asked a former IBM Master Innovator to share his five essential steps to developing successful digital assistants:\\n\\n- 1. Learn from the real subject experts, not the software developers. Focus on the SMEs - such as call centre managers and agents - who have the closest interaction with your customers. They know what people are asking for and how best to respond.\\n- 2. Choose tooling that enables your SMEs (not your developers) to get their knowledge into the Digital Assistant\u2026 quickly and effortlessly.\\n- 4. Have decent analytics in place from day one, so your SMEs can see how the technology is performing and make any necessary tweaks or improvements. Remember, this is an iterative process. Digital Assistants are like willing puppies in need of training. They perform worst when launched but rapidly learn to improve.\\n- 5. Above all, listen to what people - both customers and employees - really need. This is particularly critical in the context of Covid-19 because the rate at which things are changing is accelerating faster than ever. Tomorrow's question will be very different from today's\u2026 and so will the answer.\\n\\nTaking all of these comments into account, let us close this chapter - with this take-home message\u2026 Digital Assistants are proven technology. They can be deployed fast - and at scale - to massively reduce customer and employee pressure points. They are very secure, highly cost-effective, always available, extremely versatile and they deliver consistent value.\\n\\nDo not hesitate to exploit them. You do not need a proof-of-concept. You do not need to develop an MVP. Just do it. Your competitors are already ahead of you.\\n\\nIf you would like to learn more and to explore the power of digital assistants, we would be delighted to introduce you to our world-class experts.\\n\\n## Four\\n\\n## How to develop apps remotely\u2026 at speed\u2026 and with no code\\n\\nIn this chapter we discover:\\n\\n- \u00b7\\tHow\\ta\\tClustre\\tfirm\\thelped\\tthe\\tNHS\\tdevelop\\ta\\tlife-saving\\tapp\\tin\\tjust\\t6\\tweeks\\t-\\tturning\\t'mission impossible' into a world-beating success story.\\n- \u00b7 How to build a fully-functioning, mobile business app\u2026 in under an hour\u2026 and without using a single line of code.\\n\\nThese are all critical, non-trivial challenges - so let's take a serious look at apps\u2026\\n\\nHow Track and Trace was turned from a poisoned chalice into a top-rated app\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nWhen trials of the initial NHS Covid-19 App revealed some serious challenges, people began to view it as a poisoned chalice. It was back to the drawing board and, with some justification, many wondered whether Track and Trace had turned into mission impossible.\\n\\nHowever, under new direction and leadership, the project took on a new life. And a new urgency. With Covid cases and death tolls rising, fresh teams were drafted in to support this vital initiative. One of them was a leading app development and engineering team from the Clustre community.\\n\\nThese questions sharply divide the tech community. Some are hard-line doubters - claiming that complex apps can only be created in a tight team environment where everyone works in the same physical space. Others assert that distance is no obstacle to creating app excellence and are passionate champions of remote working. Polarised by prejudice and pragmatism, we asked the digital solutions director from the Track and Trace app development team for his definitive perspective\u2026\\n\\nThese are just some of the highlights from the most intensive and critical project ever tackled\u2026\\n\\nCan you develop complex apps from a distance? Can remote working ever work?\\n\\n'In a perfect world, a close-knit team working in the same location is everyone's idea of Utopia. But we don't live in a perfect world. We live in a world of lockdowns and social distancing. And we also live in a world that cannot wait for solutions - we had just 6 short weeks to deliver a life-saving app. Like it or not, remote working was our only realistic option.\\n\\n## How to develop apps remotely\u2026 at speed\u2026 and with no code\\n\\nSpeed was a crucial part of our success.

Since if I very quickly give you some some examples. So you will if you watch the news in Ukraine and elsewhere, you will recognize increasingly. Today's Soldier needs to be as proficient with applications as he or she does with their rifle. So on the left hand side a British Army regiment called The Royal answers tested all of their soldiers 500 of them to skills map them and allow commanders to identify and exploit the latent talent in their unit. Inevitably what they discovered was many of those with a greatest aptitude in their regiment were not in rules that required them to exploit digital skills. And we identified the talent they in cyber software engineering and the like they then ran a six week boot camp to upskill them with the required skills. And they did this before deployment to Poland you recognize why they might be in Poland at the moment given what's got going on in your crit in Ukraine and this allowed them to enhance their capability to fuse multitude and multitude of data sources from drones satellites radio transmissions and messaging ultimately a land commanders to make faster and better decisions. In Camp, they use the same the same skills. So they're coding in Barracks applications just to make the the business as usual activity of the region at regiment more efficient everything from career management through to military closing clothing requests and tracking their Fitness. This bottom up medal model is then informing the ministry defense at defense wide level. So there's one example on the right hand side in Canada. They worked with health Canada and the Canadian public health agency who had significant gaps in their digital skills. To deliver digital literacy at sorry digital literally program to their existing Workforce in the case of the Canadians. They wanted up skills 600 public servants with with essential skills that they didn't they didn't have so essentially they were identifying latent Talent. So a latent potential in their existing Workforce and then upskilling them. And final example back in the UK this time Northrop Grumman. The very large defense and security company and like so many companies Northrop Grumman UK are operating against a what a this backdrop of a lack of digital skills in the market. They not recruitment also wanted very specifically diversity of background and approach in their recruiting. They could see the the validity of having that that diversity. So they partnered with with you with me to bring new Talent into their cyber and intelligence businesses as a first step. They've taken on tenant individuals from with you with me Diverse talent pool. And are now giving them employment to meet their digital requirements and one of the most valid things for Northrop Grumman has been that diversity of thought that these employees are bringing to them. Not just the digital skills. And not a criminal just one of the many companies in UK who are now partnering with with you with me on this basis. So just just to wrap up then I think I hope everyone would on. This call would recognize it's in everyone's interest to broaden the aperture through which we find digital talent and to focus on potential not necessarily experience and that we've got to find smarter way ways to do that with you with me are absolutely focused on this what they get out of bed to do every single day. They're doing great things. They're still quite new to the United Kingdom by know that there'd be delighted to talk to you about how they can potentially help. With that I will hand back to Robert and unshare my screen. Robert I think you're on mute. My joke was then lost. I was the only person that heard it so I'm going to skip it. So thank you Rupert. And so can I now turn to Andrew Holmes of skillsoft to tell us how his company helps other companies skill and upskill people in the art of digital. You certainly can Robert. Let me just share my screen. so Good morning, everyone Andrew Holmes from skillsoft. And really interesting talk there from for Rupert with you with me all around kind of assessing the the suitability of candidates to take on you digital roles. Skillsoft is really a company that helps then organizations execute on that Vision, so Typically our customers tend to be large organizations traditional businesses and really the the keep challenge or the key problem that we're helping them solve within this perfect storm is how you actually go about driving large-scale skills transformation. So it's impossible really to hire at any at any same time four or five thousand new employees. So really we're helping organizations do more with what they already have through our Workforce transformation and upskilling solutions. There's any number of sort of Statistics going around depending on depending on who you listen to these are taken from the world economic forum, and they're really looking at it's what are the key roles that organizations are beginning to prioritize and what are the skills that underpin those roles? Therefore that organizations are going to need over the next two three four five years to do in order to remain competitive. So many of these skills are very very different than perhaps would have been the priority five years ago. So when again a lot of our large organizations have existing workforces in many cases may have been there doing a specific job for quite some period of Time. How do you bring about that change towards these digital skills and begin to close that digital skills Gap as you'll see here many of almost all of these roles. Require technical skills and I think it's Gartner that says by by 2030 up to 80% of all jobs will require technical skills and Technical knowledge and that's probably a conservative estimate to be honest. So helping organizations kind of think through. Okay, what what do we have today within our Workforce and and how which which of these roles are key for us? And how do we begin to change at scale thousands of workers and put them through a program that's going to help them gain these skills so they can fulfill these critical roles around Big Data AI software development. That's really what skillsoft is doing and we're helping organizations do that.
