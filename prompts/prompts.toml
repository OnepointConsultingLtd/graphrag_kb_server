Make sure that you rank them also according to the user interests. On top you should have the most relevant entities according to the user interests.

  Also divide the entities into two groups:
  - high-level keywords: Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.
  - low-level keywords: Identify low-level key words that summarize more specific topics or subconcepts that are related to the high-level keywords.

  For example: high-level concept "AI" has the following low-level keywords: "machine learning", "deep learning", "natural language processing", "computer vision", "robotics", "automation", "data science", "analytics", "cloud computing", "blockchain", "cybersecurity", "internet of things", "augmented reality", "virtual reality", "mixed reality"

  If the question is provided, use it to find extra entities that are related to the question.

<question>

<user_profile>
{user_profile}

<entities>
{entities}

<topics_of_interest>
