Topic:  Data Governance
One common challenge with a data lake architecture is the lack of oversight on the contents of raw data stored in the data lake. Organizations need governance, semantic consistency, and access controls to avoid the pitfalls of creating a data swamp with no curation. Data catalogs play a crucial role in data governance by providing a centralized and organized repository of metadata and information about an organization's data assets. In active metadata management, metadata is not just stored and documented, it is continuously updated, enriched, and used in real-time to support various data management and data governance activities. The rich ecosystem of metadata connectors and dynamic discovery or crawling of data assets are key enablers for active metadata management. Data governance, focuses on the broader aspects of managing and governing data assets, including data quality, privacy, and compliance, while AI governance specifically addresses the ethical, transparent, and accountable use of AI technologies. These two governance areas often intersect and complement each other to ensure that AI systems are built on high-quality, compliant, and ethically managed data. 

Topic: Data Security
Data security primarily focuses on protecting data assets, including data at rest, data in transit, and data in use. It encompasses the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Data masking, anonymization, tokenization, classification, and data privacy are important components of data security strategies aimed at protecting sensitive and confidential information. Data security encompasses a broader range of measures and practices aimed at protecting data assets throughout their lifecycle. AI security is a subset of data security that focuses specifically on the security of AI technologies, models, and algorithms. AI security deals with specific threats and risks associated with AI systems including machine learning models, algorithms, and AI applications. These threats may include adversarial attacks, model vulnerabilities, data poisoning, and model inversion attacks that target AI models and their operations. Data poisoning is a significant concern in AI/ML, especially when models are used in safety-critical applications like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

Topic: Data Infrastructure
Edge computing moves data processing and analysis close to endpoints where data is generated, to deliver real-time responsiveness and reduce the cost associated with transferring large amounts of data. Edge computing can pre-process data, extract relevant information, and perform initial analytics locally. After this initial processing, summarized or relevant data can be sent to a data lake or edge network for further analysis, archival, and integration with historical data. Fog computing is a decentralized computing paradigm that extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network, typically one or more hops away from the edge devices. It can be thought of as an intermediate layer between the edge devices and the centralized cloud. Organizations often require both real-time analytics at the edge and more extensive, historical analysis in a centralized data lake. Hybrid analytics solutions combine edge computing, fog computing with cloud or data lake-based analytics to provide a holistic view of data. It is important to conduct a thorough assessment of data lake, AI platform requirements and workloads to determine the appropriate cost effective infrastructure need for processing power. Emergence of hybrid cloud capabilities make it a valuable tool for organizations pursuing a comprehensive data lake strategy that spans multiple environments including edge, on-premise and multiple cloud service providers. Such capabilities include a cloud-centric container platform to run computationally intensive workloads by AI/ML applications utilizing CPU’s, GPU’s at scale. Most AI/ML workloads are cloud native in nature, deployed in containers and optimized to work with GPUs. They need to co-exist with other workloads on a shared infrastructure which results in a mix of virtual machines (VMs) and containers.

Operationalizing Data Lakes
While DevOps, DataOps and MLOps share a focus on automation, collaboration, and efficiency, they have distinct areas of emphasis. DevOps is primarily concerned with software development and deployment, while DataOps is focused on data-related processes and workflows. DataOps seeks to address challenges related to data integration, data quality, and data delivery, making it more tailored to the needs of data-driven organizations. MLOps is specifically focused on managing and operationalizing machine learning models, ensuring they perform well in production environments. By supporting interoperability of machine learning (ML) models, such as using the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format or PMML, ML models can be easily shared and deployed across different ML frameworks and inference engines.
Integrating DevOps, DataOps, and MLOps for a data lake requires a comprehensive strategy that promotes collaboration, automation, and efficient workflows across these disciplines. There is a need to effectively integrate DevOps, DataOps, and MLOps practices to create a cohesive and efficient data lake environment that supports data quality, data delivery, and machine learning model deployment in a streamlined and automated manner.
