Guiding yourself in Meditation Practice 2

The second practice in BK Meditation is to establish a connection with the Supreme Soul. Here are descriptions of ways you may choose to do that. Each description comes with some suggested thoughts for meditation. You donâ€™t always have to listen to a guided commentary.

Repeat and expand these thoughts gently to yourself, allowing them to take root deeply in your mind.

The audio track at the top of this page is a 5 minute music track. Play the music as you guide your own thoughts using one of the suggestions below.

### Quiet Companion
I slow my thoughts, and become aware of the lovely silence inside me, especially in the spaces between my thoughts. The silence is just what I need, and enables me to tap into the deep reservoir of peace within me. I relax into the sound of silence. And I listen for the quiet company of the Supreme Soul, the most powerful and most silent mind I have ever met.

### Sitting in the Aura of Light
I see myself in my mind's eye as a point of light, a point of pure energy, the soul. There's an aura of light surrounding me. I turn my attention to the supreme soul. The Supreme Soul is a point of light, with an aura of light, like me. I sense an invitation from the Supreme Soul to come closer, and I take myself into the aura of light. I feel safe, nurtured, welcomed.

### Magnetic Attraction
I reconnect with the feeling of being a soul, no longer contained by the limits of a physical body. I tune in to the pure loving energy that runs through the universe, and I want to come close to the source of this pure energy. I allow myself to be drawn towards the loving heart of the universe, just like a compass needle is attracted to the North.

### Fountain of Light
I sense myself as a soul, a simple living light. I am underneath a gentle fountain of light. Droplets of light continuously fall softly over me, filling me with energy. Each colour represents a different soul quality: peace, love contentment, freedom, will-power, happiness. I am immersing myself in this life-giving fountain. I can take whatever I need.

### Transmitting my Message
I sit in soul awareness. I remember the Supreme Soul in a world of light. Just as easily as sending an email, I transmit a message that says simply, "I am here." I wait for a reply.

### Sunset
I am a soul, weightless and free. I visualise myself in the middle of a beautiful sunset. I float, suspended in the wonderful golden light all around me. I am home. Ahead of me is the source of this glorious golden light, a soft radiant sun. A profound sense of belonging wells up in my heart.

### Beam of Light
I imagine myself floating like a star in the cool midnight blue calmness of infinite space. I am in orbit around a powerful sun. Bright light is radiating out in all directions. A beam of light comes directly towards me and I absorb the light into my entire being. Whatever I seek is contained in this light and I feel myself being restored to fullness and wholeness.

### Recharging my Battery
Aware of the drain on my power supply, I reach out to the unlimited energy source. The connection is vibrant and instant. As soon as I remember the Supreme Soul, the energy

Pay It Forward  
I am energy. I am life-force. I am light. In my pure form of light, I find myself in the presence of the ever-pure light, the Supreme Soul, whose light shines upon me, I absorb all that I need. When I am full, I reflect the light onwards.

The Laboratory of Light  
I think about the great scientific discoveries of this era. The knowledge of sub-atomic particles and vibrations, quantum physics, the theory of matter being light, vibrating at a slower frequency. I contemplate my wonderful soul light. I experiment with the great energy that is generated when I connect with the Supreme Light.

Unconditional Love  
I am a soul, dwelling in this body. I am in the company of the eternally loving Supreme Soul, who loves me unconditionally as I am. I am held in a cocoon of love, warming me to the core of my being. I let go any sadness in me, releasing it into the light that surrounds me and I allow love to fill the empty spaces in my heart.

The Great Healer  
I am in need of soul-health. Diseases of the soul have weakened and limited me. I take myself to the great soul surgeon. Laser light surgery removes anything negative, anything which is not contributing to my well-being. I receive coloured light therapy, to replenish my healthy positive energy. I trust this surgeon completely to restore me to my most positive and vibrant self.
