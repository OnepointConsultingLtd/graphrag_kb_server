Method Two: Progressive Muscle Relaxation
This technique asks you to tense then release different parts of your body. Tense your muscles, squeezing them tightly, then relax your muscles and let go. Remember to breathe out as you let go. You can take yourself through this step-by-step or using a guided commentary.
