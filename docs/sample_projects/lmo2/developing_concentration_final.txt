Developing concentration

Like many people, you may find that, when you sit to meditate, you cannot control the mind chatter. The modern world overexposes us to information, ideas and entertainment. This contributes to a short attention span and makes it hard to concentrate.

It takes time and practice to develop concentration and improve your attention span. When you want to get physically fit, you gradually train your body. In meditation, you need to train your mind.
