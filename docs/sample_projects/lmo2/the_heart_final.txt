The heart

One way to engage yourself more fully in your meditation experience is to involve your heart. Your mind seeks meaning and understanding. Your heart seeks relationship and love. Firstly, you understand with your mind that you are a soul and that you can connect with an unlimited energy source.

To go more deeply into this connection, you establish a relationship. You connect through feelings.
