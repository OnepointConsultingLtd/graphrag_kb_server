Restoring a healthy self respect

To regain self respect, you need to understand, “Who am I?” As you go deeper into this question, you discover a hidden world of masks and facades within. 

As you continue your daily meditation practice, you will learn how to recognise and remove the masks. You will come to know, appreciate and love the real you.
